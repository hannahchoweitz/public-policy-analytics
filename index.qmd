## About Me
My name is Hannah. I'm a third year Landscape Architecture student. I grew up in Michigan but have lived on the East Coast for the past 10 years, in Boston and NYC. I'm taking this course because I'm interested in building my proficiency with handling large spatial data sets and visualizing them in GIS.
